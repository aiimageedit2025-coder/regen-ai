      <h2>2. Data We Collect, Process and Use</h2>

      <h3>Face Data We Collect</h3>
      <p>
        We analyze your photos to find the feature points of the faces in the photos (e.g. eyes, nose, mouth points) for face processing. We do not collect or store facial data. After the analysis process, all data will be deleted and no data will be saved.
      </p>

      <h3>Purpose and Process of Collecting Face Data</h3>
      <p>
        In order to provide the <strong>"face swap"</strong> effect, we need to identify feature points such as eyes, nose, and mouth.
      </p>
      <div class="highlight">
        <ol>
          <li>You submit the selected photo to our server in an encrypted way.</li>
          <li>The server analyzes the face data and applies it to the selected template.</li>
          <li>The final rendered result is returned to you through the App.</li>
          <li>The final composite image is temporarily stored in encrypted storage and permanently deleted after a certain period of time.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          After the compositing process is complete, the original face image you submitted is deleted immediately.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Face Data Sharing and Storage</h3>
      <p>
        We do not share your face data with any third party, nor do we store any face information. Uploaded photos are deleted once the analysis process is complete.
